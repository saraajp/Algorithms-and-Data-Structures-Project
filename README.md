IST Navigate - The Infinite Loop of Doom
----------------------------------------


The main goal is to create a program where a student moves through a rectangular map, with each cell
having an energy value. The goal is to increase the studentâ€™s energy in exactly k steps, without revisiting
any cells and without letting the energy drop below zero. In the end, the student should either reach a
target energy level or gain the highest possible energy.
